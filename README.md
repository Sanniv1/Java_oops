## 🚀 About the Project

This repository aims to provide a hands-on approach to understanding OOP concepts in Java. Whether you're a beginner or looking to refresh your skills, this project offers valuable resources to enhance your understanding of:

- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation

Each concept is supported by:
- **Code examples** to illustrate usage.
- **Exercises** for practice.
- **Explanations** to clarify the theory.

## 📘 Key Concepts Covered

1. **Classes and Objects**  
   - Creating and using classes and objects.
   - Understanding constructors.

2. **Inheritance**  
   - Extending classes.
   - Using `super` keyword.

3. **Polymorphism**  
   - Method overloading and overriding.
   - Dynamic method dispatch.

4. **Abstraction**  
   - Interfaces and abstract classes.

5. **Encapsulation**  
   - Access modifiers (`private`, `public`, etc.).
   - Getters and setters.

6. **Additional Topics**
